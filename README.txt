This is the ISDA Mobile Application.
The ISDA features a camera scanning/detection function which can determine the status of a certain species whether it is legal for the market or not (illegal). Aside from the camera scanning, the user can also browse a species' information through the Fish Data page of the application.

-- to run the application -- 
API:
1. In the command prompt, change the directory to the api folder
2. run python detection.py

Mobile Application:
1. Open mobile emulator and run the flutter program

*since this is a prototype, this application only supports one way transmission from the mobile app and the API. The API only sends the scanned result to the mobile application but the mobile application cannot send pictures to the API
